    <h1>Re: Albert Momo University application</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Dear Mr. Momo</p>
    <p>Think you for recent application to join at the Starz University's science family to stydy as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, how eveer it would suit us better if you could start at the beginningof a semester, the start dates for each one are as follow:</p>
    <p>First Semester: 9 October 2022<br>Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>Third semester: 2 May 2023</p>
    <p>please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can fine more informationimportant university dates on your website.</p>
    <h2>Subject of Study</h2>
    <p>At the Starz UNiversity, we have a pretty open-minded research falicity--as long as the subjests fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You same like an intelligent,dedicated reseacher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigud by are as follows, in other priority:</p>
            <p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Reveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3)</sub> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (80<sup>o</sup>F), when thwe audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3*10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3*10<sup>4</sup>.) </p>
            <p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>
            <p>So please can ypu provide more information on each of those subjects, including how long you'd expect the reseach to take, require staff and other resource, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thinks.</p>
            <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
            <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
            <p><dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt></p>
            <p><dd>A litter known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole villege would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd></p>
            <p><dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt></p>
            <p><dd>Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,which involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modem style such as Twerking.</dd></p>
            <p><bt>Arctic robot dance</bt></p>
            <p><dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northem Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discoveredthat they wher just moveing like this because they were really cold.</bb></p>

    <p><dt>Yours sincerely,</dt></p>
